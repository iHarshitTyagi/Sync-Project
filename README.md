For your project presentation on the effectiveness of different AC models in vehicles, you can create a structured and visually appealing PowerPoint. Here's a step-by-step guide to organize and include all your data and findings effectively:

### Slide 1: Title Slide
- **Title:** Evaluating Air Conditioning Effectiveness in Vehicle Models
- **Subtitle:** Analysis of Cooling Rates in Models YHB, YHC, YTB, YXA, and YFG
- **Your Name:** Harshit
- **Date:** [Date of Presentation]

### Slide 2: Introduction
- **Objective:** To assess the effectiveness of AC systems in different vehicle models by analyzing the rate of temperature change.
- **Methodology Overview:** Describe the steps taken to filter and analyze the data.

### Slide 3: Data Preprocessing
- **Data Description:** Briefly describe the dataset and the initial number of instances.
- **Filtering:** Explain the process of removing instances where the AC was off.

### Slide 4: Trip Grouping
- **Grouping Instances:** Explain how you grouped continuous instances into trips.
- **Criteria for Trips:** Define the minimum duration of 10 minutes for trips where the AC was on.

### Slide 5: Rate of Temperature Change Calculation
- **Calculation Method:** Describe how you calculated the rate of temperature change (difference from the next minute).
- **Criteria for Analysis:** Emphasize the focus on trips longer than 10 minutes.

### Slide 6: Model-wise Box Plot Analysis
- **Box Plot Introduction:** Explain what a box plot represents in terms of statistical data.
- **Box Plot for Each Model:** Show a box plot for each of the five vehicle models (YHB, YHC, YTB, YXA, YFG).

### Slide 7: Results Interpretation
- **General Findings:** Summarize the overall cooling rates across different models.
- **Anomalies in YHC and YFG:** Highlight the 5% of vehicles in YHC and YFG with negative or zero cooling rates.

### Slide 8: Possible Causes for Anomalies
- **Factors Affecting Cooling:** Discuss potential reasons why some vehicles showed negative or zero cooling rates (e.g., AC malfunction, environmental factors).
- **Further Investigation:** Suggest further analysis or tests that could be conducted to understand these anomalies better.

### Slide 9: Conclusion
- **Effectiveness Summary:** Summarize the effectiveness of each AC model based on the cooling rates.
- **Implications for Users:** Discuss what these findings mean for vehicle users and manufacturers.

### Slide 10: Recommendations
- **Improvement Suggestions:** Provide recommendations for improving AC performance in vehicles, especially for models with identified issues.
- **Next Steps:** Outline potential future work or studies to expand on these findings.

### Slide 11: Q&A
- **Invite Questions:** Open the floor for questions from the audience.
- **Discussion:** Be prepared to discuss specific details of your analysis and findings.

### Tips for Designing the PPT:
1. **Use Visuals:** Include graphs, charts, and images to make the data more understandable and engaging.
2. **Keep Text Minimal:** Use bullet points to summarize information and avoid long paragraphs.
3. **Consistent Theme:** Maintain a consistent color scheme and font style throughout the presentation.
4. **Data Highlighting:** Use colors or bold text to highlight key findings and important data points.

This structure will help you convey your analysis clearly and effectively. If you need help with specific slides or further details, feel free to ask!


I want to make a ppt for a project where i calculate the rate of cooling (rate of temperature changes) for seeing AC effectiveness. 
I did that for 5 models ( named YHB, YHC, YTB, YXA, YFG) Each model consists about 100 vehicles. 
For calculating this first i removed the instances from the data where AC was off. 
Then when i have only those instances where AC was on, I grouped the continuous instances, we can call it Trips (which are ultimately the trips having only values where AC was on). 
Now I only kept those Trips where AC was on for at-least 10 minutes. (each trip should have 10 or more rows) 
Now I calculated the rate of temperature change by calculating the difference from the next minute.

Finally I plotted the model wise box plot.

In two vehicles YHC and YFG there were around 5% of vehicles where rate of cooling is negative (Means Inside air temperature is getting hotter than cooler) or zero.
